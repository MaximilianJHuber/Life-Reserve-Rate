# Reserve Rates

![Exhibit 5](</misc/reserve_rate.png>)

This repository hosts the reference interest rate that is refered to in the Standard Valuation Law (NAIC Model Law [820](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/model-law-820-standard-valuation-law.pdf)) for the reserve valuation of the liabilities of U.S. life insurance companies which were issued before 2018. The data was gathered from the now offline [Actuarial Outpost](https://www.actuarialoutpost.com/) forum. 

The historical rates are in the [CSV file](/data/ref_rate.csv) and current rates are published by the [NAIC](https://content.naic.org/research_moody.htm). If anyone knows the February 2021 rate, please open an issue or send send a pull request.
